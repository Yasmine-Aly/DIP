# DIP

##Using Matlab to implement DIP Algorithms applied an image and then show the results of each Filter.
##Applied Algorithms:

1.Sub-sampling.       2-Gray Scale.                     3-Negative Image.
4-Log Transform.      5-Power Transform.                6-Contrast Stretching.
7-Thresholding.       8-Gray level Slicing Approach 1.  9-Gray level Slicing Approach 2.
10-Bit Plan Slicing.  11-Adding & Substracting.         12-Substract image from image.
13-Histogram.         14-Median Filter.                 15-Average Filter.
16-Sharping Filter.   17-Laplacian Filter.              18-Sampling up.
19-ILPF.              20-BLPF.                          21-GLPF.
22-Sobel operator.    23-RGB to Gray.

##Project provided the following:
```
                               1-GUI
                               2-Reset button to make the image back to the previous status.
                               3-Allow user to enter data for algorithms that needs input.
                               4-User can apply filter on result image.
